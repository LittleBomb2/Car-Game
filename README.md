1) Running the game:

    !!! As a warning for running this game, it will automatically download libraries pygame and numpy if they aren't already installed, since they are required to run the game !!!

	Just double click the main.py script to run the game.

2) Setting the resolution:

    As the game starts a command prompt should open asking for a resolution. First it will ask for width and then after height.

    If left empty it will default to 640 for width and 480 for height.

3) Setting a name:

    This game supports a highscore system that is stored in a text file under scores.txt. 
    There are predefined highscores for the player to beat. To see your score compaired to others, you need to input a name while prompted.

    If you don't care about comparing highscores, you can leave that prompt empty, but it won't save your highscore then, except while the game is running.

	!!! FOR EVERYBODY'S ENJOYMENT, IF YOU INPUT A NAME AND IT ALREADY TELLS THAT YOU HAVE A HIGHSCORE (SEE TOP RIGHT) AND IT YOU HAVEN'T SET IT, PLEASE CLOSE THE GAME AND TRY ANOTHER NAME !!!

    This game was made during a math period, where we were going through the basics of python. So instead of doing the assignments, I made this :D.
